The main idea of this project is to make a program multi-platform that can send any file to a destiny (in a local Network).
Just choose the target select the file and send it.

The project is not completed yet, but it has some functionalities (send/receive files, find other devices) with a text interface on PC and a basic interface for Android.
There are some functionalities I would like to add, for example accept or reject the file.

Still, the purpose of this project is to explore more about Java, Interfaces, Android and keep challenging my brain.
